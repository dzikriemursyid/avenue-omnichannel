### ❌ The Actual Issue:

**WhatsApp 24-Hour Messaging Window Restriction**

## 🚨 WhatsApp Business Rules

WhatsApp has strict rules for business-initiated messages:

1. **24-Hour Window**: You can only send messages within 24 hours of customer's last message
2. **Customer Must Initiate**: For business-initiated messages outside the window, you need approved templates
3. **Template Categories**: Marketing, utility, and authentication templates have different rules

## 🔧 How to Fix

### Option 1: Test with Active Window (Immediate)

1. **Send a message FROM your WhatsApp** (+6287864457646) **TO your business number** (+628979118504)
2. Wait for confirmation
3. **Now run your campaign within 24 hours** - it will work perfectly!

### Option 2: Use Approved Templates (Production)

1. Submit templates for approval in Twilio Console
2. Use approved templates for business-initiated messages
3. Follow WhatsApp template guidelines

### Option 3: Customer-Initiated Flow (Recommended)

1. Customer sends message first (opens 24-hour window)
2. You can send any messages within that window
3. No template restrictions during active window
