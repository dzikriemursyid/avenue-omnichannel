- [ ] Backup production database
- [ ] Test rollback procedure
- [ ] Verify indexes are optimized

### 6. Infrastructure

- [ ] SSL certificates configured
- [ ] CORS settings verified
- [ ] Rate limiting configured at infrastructure level
- [ ] CDN configured for static assets

### 7. Monitoring

- [ ] Error tracking setup (Sentry/Rollbar)

- [ ] Log aggregation setup

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Pre-deployment

```bash
# Run final tests
chmod +x docs/phase4-final-test.sh
./docs/phase4-final-test.sh

# Build production bundle
npm run build

# Test production build locally
npm run start
```

### 2. Deployment

```bash
# Deploy to staging first
git push staging main

# Run smoke tests on staging
curl https://staging.your-domain.com/api/health

# Deploy to production
git push production main
```

### 3. Post-deployment Verification

- [ ] Health check endpoint responding
- [ ] Authentication flow working
- [ ] Key user journeys tested
- [ ] Performance metrics within acceptable range
- [ ] No error spikes in monitoring

## Rollback Plan

If issues are detected:

1. **Immediate Rollback**

   ```bash
   git revert HEAD
   git push production main --force-with-lease
   ```

2. **Database Rollback** (if schema changed)

   ```bash
   # Restore from backup
   pg_restore -d your_database backup.sql
   ```

3. **Cache Invalidation**
   - Clear CDN cache
   - Clear Redis cache (if used)
   - Clear browser caches (notify users)

## Performance Benchmarks

Expected performance after deployment:

| Metric                  | Target  | Actual |
| ----------------------- | ------- | ------ |
| API Response Time (p50) | < 100ms | -      |
| API Response Time (p99) | < 500ms | -      |
| Time to First Byte      | < 200ms | -      |
| First Contentful Paint  | < 1.5s  | -      |
| Time to Interactive     | < 3.5s  | -      |
